# Ireland's population Census Survey

Census survey is a data analytics program that runs on Heroku's mock Terminal.

Users can retreive population data from the survey for years 2011 to 2016, they can filter by either year(2011 or 2016 or both), gender, age and region.
The program also has the feature of exporting the user's choices into a file.

Developed by Martin Fortuna.

## Project Goals

I wanted to create an easy to manipulate program with data from Cencus, usable both to satisfy private users's curiosity and companies' marketing departments.
