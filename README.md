# Ireland's population Census Survey

Census survey is a data analytics program that runs on Heroku's mock Terminal.

Users can retrieve population data from the survey for the years 2011 to 2016, they can filter by either year(2011 or 2016 or both), gender, age, and region.
The program also has the feature of exporting the user's choices into a file.

Developed by Martin Fortuna.
